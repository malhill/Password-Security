# Password-Security

understanding the process of creating variables, giving them a function, then calling the function!

used console.log frequently to test function

completed most of the js code, most pieces in place, referenced other password generators. 

after using office hours I learned that I was using the 'return function wrong'. Being too detailed I added too many 'statements' and in other cases needed to be specific in the 'functions' of the generator.
